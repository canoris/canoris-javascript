The howto is only written in html, no doc lib is used. To update this you have to change the html code.

The code documentation is generated by jsdoc-toolkit. As a template the canDoc template is used. 
To update the code documentation, replace the canorisLib.js file in the directory jsdoc-toolkit with the new version. 
Open a terminal and enter the jsdoc-toolkit directory. Then run the following line of code: 

$ java -jar jsrun.jar app/run.js -a -t=templates/canDoc canorisLib.js 

The new documentation directory.is placed in the  ../jsdoc-toolkit/out/ directory. Copy it to the preferred location.
